        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Based on the above analysis, two conclusions were drawn from this study. Referring to park acreage, foreign-born people significantly inequitable access to fewer park acreage. Minorities also have less park acreage, showing significantly inequitable fewer park acreage of Black and Africa American population and significantly more park acreage of White population. Referring to park safety. However, there is no significant inequity in park safety from the perspective of this study. This research fills gaps in previous research related to environmental justice in New York. Because the measurements of park safety and park acreage are based on detailed lot levels, the methodology is somewhat innovative, and the results are relatively more credible. It identifies which vulnerable populations in New York City are more likely to experience inequitable access to parks.</p>
        <p>The research conclusions reveal problems in New York City. The inequity of park acreage illustrates that the history of segregation still has a negative impact on environmental justice in New York City. Additionally, foreign-born population has unequal access to smaller parks. As Figure 19 shows, foreign-born populations are concentrated in areas such as Bensonhurst, Jackson Heights, Flushing, and Jamaica, which are considered neighborhoods that are primarily for Italian, Indian, Chinese, and South Asian immigrants. Therefore, to avoid possibly causing greater social problems, the environmental injustices suffered by communities with higher concentrations of new immigrants should receive special attention.</p>

        <p>The government should pay attention to the park equity issue and propose solutions to realize environmental justice and sustainable development. The research conclusions also provide support for recommendations. The conclusion regarding park acreage shows that new parks could be provided in neighborhoods with many minorities or new immigrants to enhance environmental justice. In addition to adding new parks, another possible approach is to increase the diversity of neighborhood residents by making neighborhoods close to larger parks more inclusive of vulnerable people. The conclusion regarding park safety shows that park security services could be provided to parks near higher population density neighborhoods. Park security services do not need to be provided to neighborhoods with many specific vulnerable populations because there is no equity issue in park safety among vulnerable population.</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>a) Caution in interpreting this study’s results must be emphasized because the R-square of the models are not high. R-square values of approximately 0.215 and 0.210 means that the models cannot interpret all variations.</p>
        <p>b) Park acreage is varied across different boroughs. For example, Staten Island has an high park area per capita, which might influence the regression model or average park area amount.</p>
        <p>c) In the 2SFCA step, there are few random lots without Origin-Destination distance to any parks. It might be caused by the centroids of these tax lots failing to find the route to parks due to the fault of the street network. The results of the analysis for New York City as a whole will not be affected by this because these lots are few and randomly distributed.</p>
