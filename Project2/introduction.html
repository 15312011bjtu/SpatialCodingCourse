        <h3>Abstract</h3> <!--style="text-align:center"-->
        <p>
            Parks are important for people’s well-being, but historically, parks have worse coverage for vulnerable populations. This thesis examines whether park acreage and park safety are inequitable across vulnerable people in New York City. The network analysis, Cadastral-Based Expert Dasymetric System, two-step floating catchment area method, and weighted average method were used to measure park acreage and safety. LASSO regression algorithm was used to build regression models to detect whether there is an inequity issue so that vulnerable populations have access to less park acreage or worse park safety. The results show that the minority and foreign-born populations have inequitable fewer park acreage but that there is no significant inequity in park safety.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            Cities are important places for people to work and live. Within those cities are many essential infrastructures and public services, including parks, that are provided to support people’s lives. Parks are vitally important to ensuring citizens’ physical and mental well-being, reducing the negative impact of natural disasters, protecting the environment, and contributing to the economy (Barboza, Cirach, et al. 2021, Becketta, Freer-Smith and Taylorar 1998, Cohen, Potchter and Schnell 2014, Fausold and Lilieholm 1999 Jules, Jo, et al. 2005, Li, Deal, et al. 2018, Mennis, Mason and Ambrus 2018, Mitchell 2013, Zhang, Wang, et al. 2021). However, parks are not always equitably distributed within cities. Access to parks is often highly stratified based on income, ethno-racial characteristics, age, gender, (dis)ability, and other axes of difference (Wolch, Byrne, and Newell 2014). Such disparities in park access prevent people from equitably enjoying the benefits of parks. The United Nations’ target 11.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (Daniel 2015) states that sustainable development must “provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities.” This target also shows that vulnerable people still suffer from park inequity. Similar facts are mentioned in OneNYC 2050, which states that vibrant public spaces are an opportunity for well-being and essential for people to engage with each other, exercise, and play, and long-standing and rising income inequality, combined with a history of racial residential segregation, has led to startling health inequities mostly experienced by neighborhoods that lack opportunities for well-being (City of New York, 2019). To address inequity in issues of health, sustainable development, and beyond, it is important to know which groups of vulnerable people have fewer or less-safe parks, which OneNYC 2050 does not mention.

        <h3>Research and Purpose Question</h3>
        <p>
            This research aims to evaluate if park inequity exists in New York City by quantitative approaches. The research question is whether vulnerable people in New York City have access to smaller park acreage or parks with worse safety.

        <h3>Literature Review</h3>
        <p>The objective of the literature review section is to indicate the significance and direction of the study by reviewing previous research. First, it uncovers the importance of parks and the harms of park inequity. It then reviews the direction and results of previous research on park inequity. Finally, the limitations of previous studies are analyzed.</p>
        <p>Considering that most published research fails to provide a definition of the park and a range of terms (e.g., green space, open space, green area, urban forest, and nature) were used interchangeably with green space across all disciplines (Taylor and Hochuli 2017), these terms are used interchangeably in the following sections to refer to parks.</p>
        <p>Parks are one of the most important urban infrastructures for city residents. First, parks have a positive association with physical health due to physical activities, exposure to nature, and reducing air pollution (Barboza et al. 2021; Beckett, Freer-Smith, and Taylor 1998; Jules et al. 2005; Cohen, Potchter, and Schnell 2014). Second, many researchers have stated that people’s mental health can benefit from exposure to parks as well (Li et al. 2018; Mennis, Mason, and Ambrus 2018; Mitchell 2013; Zhang et al., 2021). Additionally, evidence suggests that urban forests may enhance the protection and resilience of cities from natural disasters (Castillo and Villanueva 2016; Brody and Highfield 2013). Moreover, open space has a positive economic impact on local communities (Fausold and Lilieholm 1999).</p>
